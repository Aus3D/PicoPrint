# PicoPrint

PicoPrint is a 32-bit 3D printer control board, designed to be fast, quiet, and compact.

PicoPrint is still in active development, and some specifications are not yet finalised. Once the design has been finalised, this page will be updated with detailed information.


## Firmware
PicoPrint is designed to run the Marlin 3D printer firmware. A version of Marlin currently running on PicoPrint can be found [here](https://github.com/Aus3D/Marlin/tree/bugfix-2.0.x-F446-PicoPrint).

Compiling and uploading the Marlin firmware will require the Arduino IDE, and a fork of the STM32Generic Hardware Core, [here](https://github.com/chrissbarr/STM32GENERIC/tree/F446VE).
